# Petal Size Ath
## Assessment of the environmental and genetic drivers of flower size variation in the self pollinating plant <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
This repository is a cleaned version of the messy repository that contains all explorations files. It is aimed at gather the scripts and data used in the manuscript only. Some files are too large to be stored in github (I mean the free version that I use). Large files were stored in my personal disk. However, script are made in a way that everything is reproducible: by running the scripts, large files can be produced and stored in your disk. Some of the bash scripts require the use of a cluster. I provide "heads" of the large files as an indication.

# Petal Size Ath

## Assessing the environmental and genetic drivers of flower size variation in the self pollinating plant <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>

This repository gather the scripts and data used in a manuscript under revision.

All used genetic data are available online (1001 genome or phytozome), and the phenotypes are provided here.

Some files are too large to be stored in github (I mean the free version that I use). Large files were stored in my personal disk. This is usually noticeable when a directory starts with "../large_files/". However, script are made in a way that everything is reproducible: by running the scripts from the beginning with publicly available data, large files can be produced and stored in your disk.

Some of the bash scripts require the use of a cluster. I will provide "head" of the large files as an indication.

This also means that scripts cannot just be run as a package, directories has to be updated and some folders and their hierarchy have to be created on the way.
